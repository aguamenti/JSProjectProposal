## Background
Perception is a multi-sensory memory game that uses animated graphics to augment the user's experience.

Upon pressing an alphabet key, an animation will appear on the screen. The player aims to remember which keys have the same associated animation, and to find all 13 matching keys.

The goal? A memory game with a twist. One that heightens the user's senses and stimulates the hippocampus.  

## Key Features

## Pending Features
- Introduce a timer feature, recording how long it takes the user to find 13 matches
- Incorporate a backend so user highscores are saved
- Explore the Howler.js library to add sounds corresponding to each
